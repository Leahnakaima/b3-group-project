It measures  government wilingness and national administrations to use information and communication technologies to deliver services. Despite Kenya and Rwanda's lead and Ethiopia and Tanzania having the least EGDI, the rates among the five countries have been on the increase between 2008 and 2018. For example, Kenya  maps wells with potable water using a mobile app and there are mobile phone-based money transfers, financing, and microfinancing services in the five countries including M-Pesa in Kenya and MTN mobile money services in most countries in East Africa. Additionally, Uganda for example improved from 0.36 in 2016 to 0.41 in 2018, which is above the African average of 0.34 in EGDI and from 0.51 to 0.57 in online service index. Finally, Rwanda is using programs like the N-Frnds platform to emerge markets and provide cutting edge solutions that allows citizens and businesses to access the digital world. The platform has created a more effective and efficient government which had enabed economic growth and development in Rwanda.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; min-width: 50%; margin-left: 200; margin-right: 800; font-family: arial;font-size: 14">Generally, intellectual property protection has been gradually increasing in the past 10 years. Its highest in Rwanda and Kenya and lowest in Uganda and Tanzania. While the IP ecosystem follows along the broad-based growth in infrastructure and innovation areas in Kenya, the relatively significant level and speed of improvement in Rwanda calls for a fresh look at the prospects of setting up digital technology-based businesses. The five countries and mostly Rwanda and Kenya have advanced legal and institutional framework for IP protection. They enforcing the law around patents and they ensure that IP owners are also legally protected in the process.</p>
